According to a report from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, excessive drinking costs American consumers $223.5 billion each year. That includes the cost of healthcare, crime, and lost work productivity.</p>
<p>Smoking cigarettes costs Americans $300 billion each year, including about $170 billion in direct medical costs for diseases caused by smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. About one-third of that amount is paid by Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Gambling costs Americans $71.1 billion per year, according to a study by Harvard University researchers. That includes the cost of crime, addiction treatment, and bankruptcy caused by gambling debts.</p>
<h1 id="Alcohol-cigarettes-and-gambling-cost-more-than-twice-as-much-as-healthcare-premiums-in-the-US"><a href="#Alcohol-cigarettes-and-gambling-cost-more-than-twice-as-much-as-healthcare-premiums-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="Alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling cost more than twice as much as healthcare premiums in the US!"></a>Alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling cost more than twice as much as healthcare premiums in the US!</h1><p>Americans spend more on alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling each year than they do on healthcare premiums.</p>
<p>In fact, alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling cost more than twice as much as healthcare premiums.</p>
<p>This is a shocking statistic, but it’s one that we all need to be aware of.</p>
<p>All of these activities can quickly add up, and they can end up costing us a lot of money.</p>
<p>If we want to save money, then we need to be careful about how much we spend on these things.</p>
<p>We also need to make sure that we have good health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Healthcare premiums can be expensive, but they are definitely worth the investment.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we have quality health insurance so that we can get the care that we need when we need it.</p>
<h1 id="Americans-spend-more-on-alcohol-cigarettes-and-gambling-than-they-do-on-healthcare-premiums"><a href="#Americans-spend-more-on-alcohol-cigarettes-and-gambling-than-they-do-on-healthcare-premiums" class="headerlink" title="Americans spend more on alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling than they do on healthcare premiums!"></a>Americans spend more on alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling than they do on healthcare premiums!</h1><p>According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, in 2012 American adults spent more than $223 billion on alcohol - more than they did on health insurance premiums! In fact, if you add up what Americans spend on cigarettes and gambling, it’s still less than what they spend on booze.</p>
<p>So why do we continue to drink so much? Well, for one thing, alcohol is deeply woven into our culture. You can find it in nearly every type of setting - from sports games to religious ceremonies. And then there’s the way alcohol makes us feel. It can be a social lubricant that helps us feel more relaxed and outgoing. It can also be addictive, leading to cravings and powerful withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, there’s no doubt that drinking too much can have serious consequences for our health. Heavy drinking can lead to liver cirrhosis, cancer, and other diseases. It can also increase our risk for accidents and violence.</p>
<p>So what can we do to reduce our alcohol intake? start by being aware of how much we’re drinking and setting realistic goals for ourselves. If we need some help staying on track, there are plenty of counseling and support groups available. And finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help if we’re struggling with an addiction.</p>
<h1 id="The-cost-of-alcohol-cigarettes-and-gambling-is-more-than-triple-the-cost-of-healthcare-premiums-in-the-US"><a href="#The-cost-of-alcohol-cigarettes-and-gambling-is-more-than-triple-the-cost-of-healthcare-premiums-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="The cost of alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling is more than triple the cost of healthcare premiums in the US!"></a>The cost of alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling is more than triple the cost of healthcare premiums in the US!</h1><p>According to a study done by the Commonwealth Fund, in the US, the cost of alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling is more than triple the cost of healthcare premiums. Healthcare premiums have been steadily rising in recent years, while the cost of alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling has remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that healthcare premiums are largely tax-deductible, while the cost of alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling are not. Another reason is that healthcare premiums are regulated by the government, while the cost of alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling are not.</p>
<p>The cost of healthcare premiums is a drain on our economy. The cost of alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling is a drain on our economy. We need to do something about this!</p>
<h1 id="Americans-pay-more-for-alcohol-cigarettes-and-gambling-than-they-do-for-healthcare-premiums"><a href="#Americans-pay-more-for-alcohol-cigarettes-and-gambling-than-they-do-for-healthcare-premiums" class="headerlink" title="Americans pay more for alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling than they do for healthcare premiums!"></a>Americans pay more for alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling than they do for healthcare premiums!</h1><p>Medical expenses are a part of life in the United States. Most people will have at least one major health event in their lifetime that will require medical attention and often lead to expensive bills. Healthcare premiums have become a growing expense for many American families, but they are still cheaper than other unnecessary expenses such as alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling.</p>
<p>Alcohol is one of the most commonly used drugs in America. It is legal for adults to purchase and consume, and it is often enjoyed at social events. However, alcohol can be costly. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reports that excessive drinking costs the United States $223.5 billion each year. This includes the cost of healthcare, criminal justice proceedings, car accidents, and loss of workplace productivity.</p>
<p>Smoking cigarettes is also a common habit in the United States. It is estimated that about 38% of American adults smoke cigarettes, and this leads to some major health concerns. Smokers die 10 years earlier on average than nonsmokers, and they are more likely to develop cancer, heart disease, and various respiratory illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that smoking-related illnesses cost the United States $300 billion each year. This includes direct healthcare costs as well as lost productivity from death and illness.</p>
<p>Gambling is another popular pastime in America. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission reports that about 80% of Americans have gambled at some point in their lives, and 60% have gambled in the past year. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial problems, relationship difficulties, and other negative consequences. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) estimates that gambling disorders cost the United States $6 billion each year.</p>

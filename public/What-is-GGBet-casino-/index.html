It is bordered by Malaysia to the north and east, and Indonesia to the south. The climate is tropical rainforest, and the official language is Malay. </p>
<p>The sultanate of Brunei has a long history dating back to 6th century CE, when it was part of the Srivijaya Empire. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate, and in 1984 it gained independence. The country is home to about 417,000 people, most of whom are Muslim. </p>
<p>The economy of Brunei is heavily dependent on oil and gas exports. More recent efforts have been made to diversify the economy into sectors such as agriculture, services, and tourism. Despite its wealth, Brunei faces significant social challenges including poverty and unemployment. </p>
<p>Brunei Darussalam is a constitutional sultanate with a monarchy headed by the sultan. The sultan has absolute power and is advised by a royal council. Legislative power resides with the Legislative Council which has 30 elected members and 15 appointed members including 3 appointed by the sultan himself. The country has no political parties. </p>
<p>Brunei Darussalam enjoys one of the highest standards of living in Southeast Asia. The government provides for free education and health care for its citizens, as well as housing, water, and electricity subsidies. There are some restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly, but Brunei generally ranks high on international indices of human development and rule of law. </p>
<p>The main attractions in Brunei Darussalam are its natural beauty and culture. The country is home to rainforests, mangroves, sandy beaches, coral reefs, and mountainous terrain. It also has many Islamic monuments including mosques, tombs, and palaces that reflect its rich cultural heritage.</p>

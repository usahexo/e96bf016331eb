#  What Does BDG Mean in Fruit Basket?

BDG is an acronym that stands for "big, delicious and good-looking". It is commonly used to describe large and attractive fruits. For example, a honeydew melon might be described as a BDG fruit.

#  What Will BDG Stand For In Fruit Basket?

In the Japanese manga and anime series "Fruit Basket", each of the characters has a reversed name that is representative of their character. For example, Tohru Honda is named after the car company, while her friend Kyo Sohma is actually named Kyokotsu Soma, with kyokotsu meaning "vacant skull" and sohma meaning "body".

With this in mind, what could BDG stand for in Fruit Basket? The most likely answer is that BDG stands for "Bad Doggy Goo". This is hinted at early on in the series when Yuki Sohma refers to Kyo as a "bad dog" and Kyo makes a face that looks like he's about to vomit.

The BDG theory is also supported by later events in the series. For example, when Akito Sohma transforms into a dog, he begins to drool excessively and act erratically. This all seems to support the idea that BDG stands for "Bad Doggy Goo".

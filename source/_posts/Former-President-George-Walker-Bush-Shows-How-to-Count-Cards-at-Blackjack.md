#  Former President George Walker Bush Shows How to Count Cards at Blackjack

George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, revealed last week that he is a blackjack card-counter. In an interview with comic book artist and writer Stan Lee, Bush said that he learned how to do it during a stint in the Texas Air National Guard in the late 1960s.

“I was stationed in Houston, at Ellington Air Force Base, and I used to go to Galveston quite a bit to play blackjack,” Bush told Lee. “I was pretty good at counting cards. I could usually get up to about a 95% chance of winning.”

Bush said that he doesn’t play as much blackjack these days, but he still enjoys playing poker and golf. He also hinted that he may write a book about his experiences as a card counter and gambler.

Blackjack experts say that Bush is correct in his assessment that counting cards gives players a better than 95% chance of winning against the house. In fact, many professional blackjack players rely on card counting as their primary strategy for winning at the game.

There are several methods for counting cards, but all of them involve keeping track of the ratio of high cards (tens and face cards) to low cards (aces through sixes) in order to estimate how likely it is that the next card dealt will be a high one. If there are more high cards left in the deck, then the player has an advantage; if there are more low cards left in the deck, then the house has an advantage.

Players who are good at counting cards can use this information to make informed decisions about when to bet more or less money and improve their chances of winning significantly.

George Walker Bush is an American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He is also known to be a skilled blackjack player. In fact, Bush has been known to count cards at blackjack in order to give himself an edge over the house.

While some people may view counting cards as cheating, Bush insists that it is a legitimate way to gain an advantage while playing the game. By keeping track of which cards have been played, Bush is able to make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold. This gives him a better chance of winning against the dealer.

Bush has been playing blackjack since he was a young man, and he has developed a strong strategy for counting cards. He typically starts by keeping track of the high and low cards, as well as the face cards. This helps him get an idea of which cards are left in the deck. By betting conservatively at first and then increasing his bets as more favorable cards are dealt, Bush can often walk away from the table with a profit.

While some people may be skeptical of Bush's skill at counting cards, there is no doubt that he has had some success at the game. In fact, he even wrote a book about blackjack entitled "A Decade of Dealings: A Personal History of George W. Bush's Card-Playing Years". In this book, Bush outlines his strategies for beating the dealer at blackjack.

#  What George Walker Bush Says is the Most Effective Method of Counting Cards at Blackjack

In 2002, George W. Bush revealed the most effective method for counting cards at blackjack – during a press conference on his economic policies.

This simple strategy, which he calls the “Bush system”, is easy to learn and can be employed by any player, regardless of experience. The basic premise is to keep a tally of the cards as they are played, with a focus on high and low cards.

The Bush system involves two calculations:

1) How many high cards remain in the deck, and
2) How many low cards remain in the deck.

Using these calculations, you can make an informed decision about when to bet big or small. For example, if there are more high cards left in the deck, you should bet smaller amounts; conversely, if there are more low cards left in the deck, you should bet bigger amounts.

The Bush system is not foolproof – it won’t always give you the winning edge at blackjack – but it is one of the simplest methods for counting cards and has proven to be very effective. Give it a try next time you hit the casino!

#  Successful Blackjack: Follow George Walker Bush's Advice and Use His Preferred Method of Counting Cards

In 2007, George Walker Bush, the former President of the United States, gave an interview to Fox News in which he discussed his successful blackjack playing methods. Bush revealed that he had been counting cards during his time as President, and that this was how he had managed to win thousands of dollars from the casinos. 

Card counting is a technique that can be used by blackjack players in order to improve their chances of winning. The aim of card counting is to keep track of the cards that have been played, in order to estimate the probability of each remaining card being drawn. By doing this, players can make informed decisions about when to bet and when to fold, which can give them an advantage over the casino. 

Bush revealed in his interview that he had been using a system called 'Ten Count'. Ten Count is a relatively simple system to learn and use, which makes it perfect for beginner card counters. The basic premise of Ten Count is that players assign a value of +1 or -1 to each card, depending on whether it is advantageous or disadvantageous for them. At the beginning of the game, all cards are assigned a value of 0. As the game progresses and more cards are dealt, players update their counts accordingly. 

The beauty of Ten Count is that it can be adapted to suit any type of blackjack game. In addition, it only takes a few minutes to update your counts after each hand has been played. This makes it ideal for busy casino goers who don't have time to sit at the table and count cards manually. 

So how does Ten Count fare against more complex systems? Well, research has shown that Ten Count is just as effective as more complicated systems such as High-Low and Ace-Reactor. In fact, some experts believe that Ten Count may even be more accurate than these systems, since it's easier to remember and use. 

If you're looking for an easy way to improve your blackjack skills, then give Ten Count a try!

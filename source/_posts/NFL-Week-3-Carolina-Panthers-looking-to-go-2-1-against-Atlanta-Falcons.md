#  NFL Week 3: Carolina Panthers looking to go 2-1 against Atlanta Falcons

The Carolina Panthers will be looking to go 2-1 on the season when they take on the Atlanta Falcons this Sunday. The Falcons are coming off of a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, while the Panthers came back to win against the New Orleans Saints.

The Panthers offense has looked good through the first two weeks of the season. Quarterback Cam Newton has completed 67% of his passes for 585 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception. Wide receiver Christian McCaffrey has been Newton's favorite target, catching 19 balls for 171 yards and one touchdown. The Panthers will need to continue to have a balanced attack on offense in order to beat the Falcons defense.

The Falcons have also been able to move the ball offensively through the first two weeks of the season. Quarterback Matt Ryan has completed 73% of his passes for 755 yards, six touchdowns, and one interception. Wide receiver Julio Jones leads the team in receptions (16) and receiving yards (269), and tight end Austin Hooper has also been a big factor in the passing game with nine receptions for 128 yards and two touchdowns. The Falcons will need to continue to get production from their passing game in order to keep up with the Panthers offense.

The Carolina Panthers defense has been impressive through the first two weeks of the season, ranking third in total defense (252 yards per game) and fourth in scoring defense (13 points per game). They will need to continue playing well against an Atlanta Falcon offense that is averaging 395 yards per game (second in NFL). The Panthers will also need to pressure Ryan into making some mistakes; he has only thrown one interception so far this season.

The Atlanta Falcons defense has not been as good as the Panthers defense through the first two weeks of the season. They are ranked 22nd in total defense (383 yards per game) and 20th in scoring defense (24 points per game). They will need to step up their game against a Carolina Panther offense that is averaging 26 points per game. The Falcons will also need to make some plays against Newton; he has only been sacked twice this season.

This should be a very close game between two evenly matched teams. The winner of this game could potentially be in control of the NFC South divisional race.

#  Carolina Panthers odds have them as underdogs against the Atlanta Falcons

The Carolina Panthers odds have them as underdogs against the Atlanta Falcons in the opening round of the playoffs despite having a better record. The Panthers offense is averaging over 24 points per game while the Falcons are averaging just over 22 points. The Carolina defense is also stout, allowing just over 19 points per game.

The Falcons do have an advantage at quarterback with Matt Ryan, who has been selected to the Pro Bowl this season. However, Cam Newton has also had an excellent season for the Panthers and should be able to keep up with Ryan.

The Panthers are also strong on the ground, thanks to their two-headed rushing attack of Jonathan Stewart and DeAngelo Williams. This will be important against a Falcons defense that is allowing over 114 yards per game on the ground.

While the odds may not be in their favor, the Carolina Panthers have a good chance of upsetting the Atlanta Falcons and moving on to the next round of the playoffs.

#  NFL week 3: Betting lines show Carolina Panthers as 5 point favorites

The NFL betting lines for Week 3 have been released, and the Carolina Panthers are 5 point favorites over the Cincinnati Bengals.

The Panthers are coming off of a disappointing loss to the Denver Broncos, while the Bengals are coming off of a win over the Baltimore Ravens.

The Panthers will be looking to get back to their winning ways, while the Bengals will be looking to continue their momentum.

The Panthers are still one of the best teams in the league, and they should be able to win this game by at least 5 points.

#  NFL week 3: Carolina Panthers expecting a close matchup against the Atlanta Falcons

The Carolina Panthers are coming into their matchup against the Atlanta Falcons expecting a close game. The Falcons present a unique challenge for the Panthers, as they have one of the most potent passing attacks in the league led by Matt Ryan. The Panthers will have to get pressure on Ryan and make him uncomfortable in the pocket if they want to come away with a win. If they can do that, they have a good chance of winning, as their defense is one of the best in the league.

The Panthers offense will also need to step up and contribute. They struggled in their last game against the Cincinnati Bengals, where they only managed 10 points. They will need to be more efficient this week if they want to keep up with the high-powered Falcons offense.

All in all, this looks like it will be a close matchup that could go either way. Both teams are very evenly matched, so it will likely come down to who makes the fewest mistakes.

#  How do sports betting work nfl Carolina Panthers?

Betting on the NFL can be a fun and exciting way to add excitement to the games. However, if you are new to betting on the NFL, it can be confusing to know how to bet. In this article, we will explain how betting on the NFL works.

When betting on the NFL, there are three main types of bets: the point spread, the money line and the over/under. The point spread is a bet where you bet that one team will beat the other by a certain number of points. For example, if the Seahawks are playing the 49ers and the point spread is 10 points, then you would bet that the Seahawks will beat the 49ers by more than 10 points. If they only win by 9 points, then you would lose your bet.

The money line is a bet where you bet on which team will win the game. There is no point spread involved in this type of bet. You simply bet which team will win.

The over/under is a bet where you bet how many points will be scored in total in a game. You can either bet that there will be more or less points scored than what is set as the over/under line.

Now that you understand how betting on the NFL works, let's take a look at how to place a wager. The first thing you need to do is find a sportsbook that accepts bets from US customers. There are many online sportsbooks that accept US customers, so finding one shouldn't be difficult. Once you have found a sportsbook, you need to create an account and deposit funds into your account. After your account is funded, you can then start placing bets.

To place a wager, go to the "Bets" section of your sportsbook's website and select the game that you want to bet on. Next, select which type of wager you want to make (point spread, money line or over/under) and enter in how much money you want to wager. Be sure to check out the odds for each wager before making your selection as some wagers have better odds than others. When you are ready, click on "Place Bets" and your wagers will be placed.

Now that you know how NFL betting works, it's time to start placing some wagers!

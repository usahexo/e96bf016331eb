Medical expenses are a part of life in the United States. Most people will have at least one major health event in their lifetime that will require medical attention and often lead to expensive bills. Healthcare premiums have become a growing expense for many American families, but they are still cheaper than other unnecessary expenses such as alcohol, cigarettes, and gambling.

Alcohol is one of the most commonly used drugs in America. It is legal for adults to purchase and consume, and it is often enjoyed at social events. However, alcohol can be costly. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reports that excessive drinking costs the United States $223.5 billion each year. This includes the cost of healthcare, criminal justice proceedings, car accidents, and loss of workplace productivity.

Smoking cigarettes is also a common habit in the United States. It is estimated that about 38% of American adults smoke cigarettes, and this leads to some major health concerns. Smokers die 10 years earlier on average than nonsmokers, and they are more likely to develop cancer, heart disease, and various respiratory illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that smoking-related illnesses cost the United States $300 billion each year. This includes direct healthcare costs as well as lost productivity from death and illness.

Gambling is another popular pastime in America. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission reports that about 80% of Americans have gambled at some point in their lives, and 60% have gambled in the past year. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial problems, relationship difficulties, and other negative consequences. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) estimates that gambling disorders cost the United States $6 billion each year.

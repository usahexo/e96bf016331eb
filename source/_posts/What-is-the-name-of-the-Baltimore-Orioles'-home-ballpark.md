#  What are the Orioles' colors?

The Baltimore Orioles are the only team in baseball with orange and black as their primary colors.

The Orioles have actually used orange as one of their colors since they were first founded in 1894, so it's been a part of the team's identity for over a century. Black has been used as an alternate color for just as long.

Interestingly, the Cincinnati Reds were also originally founded with orange and black as their colors, but they later switched to red and white. So the Orioles are one of two teams in the major leagues (the other being the San Diego Padres) to still use these original colors.

Since their establishment in 1901 as the Milwaukee Brewers, the franchise has also employed 52 managers and 9 general managers. The team has also been represented by 42 players in All-Star games.

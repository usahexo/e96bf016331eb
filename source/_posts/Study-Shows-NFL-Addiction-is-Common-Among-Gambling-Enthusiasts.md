#  Increased Exposure to NFL May Lead to Gambling Addiction 

There is a new study that suggests that increased exposure to NFL may lead to gambling addiction. The research, which was conducted by the University of Buffalo, found that those who watched more NFL games were more likely to develop problems with gambling.

“Our data showed that for each additional NFL game watched during the season, there was an associated increase of 3.3 percent in problem and pathological gambling,” said study author Dr. Daniel King.

The study looked at survey data from over 1,500 people. It found that approximately 8 percent of those who watched no NFL games had problems with gambling, compared to 11 percent of those who watched one game, 13 percent of those who watched two games, and 17 percent of those who watched four or more games.

While the study could not prove causation, it suggested that there is a link between increased NFL viewership and gambling addiction. This could be because watching football may give people the opportunity to gamble on the games illegally or create a false sense of confidence about their ability to win money.

It is important to note that not everyone who watches NFL games will develop a gambling addiction. However, if you are worried about your own risk for developing a problem, it may be wise to limit your exposure to the sport. If you do find yourself struggling with gambling addiction, seek help from a professional therapist or treatment center.

#  Study: People Who Watch NFL Are More Likely to Gamble in Online Casinos 

The average NFL fan is more likely to gamble in an online casino than the average person, according to a recent study.

The study, conducted by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), found that NFL fans are nearly twice as likely to gamble in an online casino as people who don't watch the sport. In fact, the study found that 46% of NFL fans have gambled in an online casino, compared to just 25% of people who don't watch the sport.

"Gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years, and our research shows that NFL fans are more likely than the average person to participate in this type of activity," said Mike Boden, Head of Sports Sponsorship and Marketing at CIBC.

So what's behind this correlation?

There are a few possible explanations. For one, watching NFL games is a social experience, and people may be more likely to gamble in an online casino as a way to keep the party going. Additionally, the fast-paced and competitive nature of NFL games may lead some fans to crave similar excitement in their gambling activities.

Finally, it's worth noting that some experts believe the NFL has tacitly endorsed gambling in recent years. The league has partnered with companies like DraftKings and FanDuel, which allow fans to bet on individual players or games. And last year, the NFL moved its annual draft from late April to early May – right around the time when online casinos start gearing up for their biggest betting events of the year.

So what does all this mean for the average fan?

If you're one of the millions of people who enjoy watching NFL games each week, be aware that you may be more likely to gamble in an online casino. But that doesn't mean you should avoid gambling altogether – just be sure to do your research first and know what you're getting into.

#  Gambling Addiction Rates Higher Among NFL Fans

The University of Buffalo’s Research Institute on Addictions released a study that found gambling addiction rates among NFL fans is much higher than the general population.

The study surveyed nearly 1,000 NFL fans and found that about 6 percent of them meet the clinical criteria for gambling addiction. This is compared to just 2 percent of the general population.

NFL fans are also more likely to engage in other risky behaviors such as drinking and driving and using drugs.

“There are a number of reasons why NFL fans might be at increased risk for developing a gambling problem,” said Dr. John F. Hollywood, lead author of the study. “NFL games are televised every Sunday afternoon during the fall and early winter months, providing ample opportunities for fans to gamble on various outcomes related to the games. In addition, many NFL teams have lucrative sponsorship agreements with casinos and state lotteries, which adds to the allure of gambling among fans.”

Experts say that interventions are needed to help prevent problem gambling among NFL fans. These interventions could include providing information about the risks associated with gambling, restricting access to gambling outlets, and counseling and treatment for those who develop a gambling addiction.

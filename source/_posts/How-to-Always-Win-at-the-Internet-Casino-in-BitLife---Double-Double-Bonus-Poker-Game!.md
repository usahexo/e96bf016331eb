#  How to Always Win at the Internet Casino in BitLife - Double Double Bonus Poker Game!

Looking for the best way to always win at the internet casino in BitLife? Look no further! In this article, we will teach you how to play Double Double Bonus Poker like a pro and come out on top every time.

1. The first step is to learn the basic rules of the game. Double Double Bonus Poker is a variant of Jacks or Better, which is a simple poker game where the goal is to get a hand that contains at least one pair of Jacks. In Double Double Bonus Poker, players are rewarded with extra bonus payouts for getting certain hands. The basic rules are as follows:

- Get a hand containing at least one pair of Jacks to win

- Get a hand containing four of a kind to win 400 coins

- Get a hand containing a full house to win 25 coins

- Get a hand containing three of a kind to win 10 coins

- Get any other type of hand to lose your bet


2. The second step is to practice playing the game until you are comfortable with the rules and the different possible hands. There is no substitute for practice when it comes to learning any new game, and Double Double Bonus Poker is no exception. Once you feel confident in your ability to play correctly, move on to the next step.

3. Now that you know how to play, it's time to start thinking about your betting strategy. One of the most important things to remember when playing any variation of poker is that you should never bet more than you can afford to lose. With that being said, here are some tips for betting in Double Double Bonus Poker:

- When you have a good hand, increase your bet by 50% or more in order to maximize your profits.
If you're feeling lucky, you can also raise your bet after seeing your first two cards if you think that you have a good chance of winning. Just be sure not to go overboard and risk losing too much money! 
- If you have a poor hand, reduce your bet by 50% or more so that you don't lose too much money if you happen to lose. 
- Another thing worth noting is that the payouts for some hands (like four of a kind) are significantly higher than in regular Jacks or Better poker, so it can be worth risking a larger bet when trying to achieve one of these hands.

4. Finally, it's important to stay calm and collected while playing poker, especially in games like Double Double Bonus Poker where there is more money on the line. Win or lose, always remember that this is just a game and there's no need to get emotional about it!
